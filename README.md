# How to Use : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiWHrPaNUOQ
RanRAT is a simple combination between the ransomware and the RAT [Remote Access Trojan] , This tool has better visual effects , also has good control to victims , but has only the ordinary options 
The main aim of the tool : is to control vitims easily just like armitage , and also can automate the ransomware operation for victims from special countries , also can use the console / command line , and the out trojan is by a method calles : compile on the fly , which you can Cyrpt the trojan and turn it into FUD , without being corrupted , and can also enjoy by building up your own ransomware , and simply can encrypt and decrypt files for victims 
ILLEGAL USE OF THIS Tool , is the User Responsibility                    

this tool is not 100% complete , means contains some bugs , but its advantages is for some graphics which simulates as armitage / and also can be used using command prompt provided with RAT , also this tool has constraints in its usage as i mentioned its purposes ,
# that video too old for the installer , as the published tool has no installer , and can be run easily and main advantage is the trojan file is "compiled by [compile on the fly]" which allows trojan to be crypted using ordinary crypters into a FUD one , and its source is in a txt file in resources , "i Repeat" this tool is very dangerous , the ransom options are not tested 100% , you can review the source and make sure they are working properly not on your physical machine
Thank you for your support and Attention .
Best Regards
